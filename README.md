### Hi there ðŸ‘‹   

**I am a Data Scientist, committed to continuous professional development.**   
In my view, effective data science relies on _simplicity_, _efficiency_, _streamlined_ processes, and _unified_ workflows.

The technology stack I chose is [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Below are my supporting arguments for this decision:
- Julia is fast, (optionally) typed, reproducible, [energy efficient](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/updated-functional-results-2020) 
- It has multiple [thematic organizations](https://julialang.org/community/organizations/)
- It comes with a powerful [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/)
- [Units of Measure](https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/) are easy to use
- It has an active and growing [community](https://julialang.org/community/)
- [AOT](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.11-dev/devdocs/aot/) compilation will soon be possible
<!--
# Had I not found Julia to be such a pleasant and efficient development experience, I would have been tempted to look into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):
- official 
     - [toolchain installer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) 
     - [package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) 
     - [formatter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) 
     - [linter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) 
     - [LSP](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
- compiled, performant, reliable, immutable
- [Tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) incl. a [REPL](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr)
- ML
    - [Linfa](https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/)
- DL
    - [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) PyTorch bindings
    - [Rust](https://github.com/tensorflow/rust) TensorFlow bindings
- [Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community)
- [Units of measure](https://docs.rs/uom/latest/uom/)
- [Learning resources](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
- [Energy efficiency](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/)
- [Scientific computing community](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-0h1ipMRkTkB38vDEmTbw)
