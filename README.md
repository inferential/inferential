### Hi there ðŸ‘‹   

**I am a Data Scientist, committed to continuous professional development.**   
In my view, effective data science relies on _simplicity_, _efficiency_, _streamlined_ processes, and _unified_ workflows.

#### My chosen technology stack comprises:
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). My supporting arguments for this decision:
- Julia is fast, (optionally) typed, reproducible, [energy efficient](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/updated-functional-results-2020) 
- It has a wide variety of [thematic organizations](https://julialang.org/community/organizations/)
- It comes with a very powerful [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/)
- [Multiple dispatch](https://www.juliawiki.com/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) offers great flexibility and high performance  
- [Units of Measure](https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/) are easy to use
- It has an active and growing [community](https://julialang.org/community/)
- [AOT](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.11-dev/devdocs/aot/) compilation will soon be possible   

Finally, MongoDB is easy to install, setup and use locally or on the cloud.

Had I not found Julia to offer such a pleasant and efficient development experience, I would have chosen [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):
- A compiled, performant, reliable, immutable
- It comes with great [tooling](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) incl. a [REPL](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr)
- It offers access to great [ML](https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/) and [DL](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) libraries 
- It has an active [community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community)
- It comes with [Units of measure](https://docs.rs/uom/latest/uom/)
- [Learning resources](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) are excellent
- [Energy efficiency](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/) is also a major plus
- The [Scientific computing community](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-0h1ipMRkTkB38vDEmTbw) is embracing it
